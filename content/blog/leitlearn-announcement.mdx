From **December 2024**, we embarked on an exciting journey to **revive and reinvent Leitlearn.com**, a web platform based on the **Leitner method** of spaced repetition using flashcards.

Originally launched in **January 2024** as a **PHP-based application**, the website had to close after a few months due to time constraints. Now, with renewed ambition and a more advanced tech stack, Leitlearn.com is set to relaunch as a comprehensive learning application built with **NextJS**, with availability planned for **2025**.

## The Vision Behind Leitlearn.com

The Leitner method is a proven learning strategy that enhances memory retention by spacing out review sessions.
Leitlearn.com aims to make this approach more accessible and engaging by combining **intuitive design** and **modern technology**, allowing users to create, organize, and practice flashcards efficiently.

## A Complete Overhaul with NextJS

To transform the original concept into a powerful and scalable web application, the following technologies were employed:

- **Frontend and Backend Integration**: Leveraged **NextJS** for server-side rendering and a seamless user experience.
- **Database Management**: Used **PostgreSQL** for robust and efficient data handling.
- **Responsive Design**: Crafted a **custom responsive design** from scratch to provide a unique and tailored identity for Leitlearn, ensuring an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Key Features of the New Leitlearn.com

The revamped Leitlearn.com is packed with features designed to improve the learning process:

- **Custom Flashcard Creation**: Users can easily create, edit, and organize their own flashcard decks.
- **Leitner Box System**: Automatically schedules review sessions based on user performance, optimizing retention.
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Tracks progress, showing metrics such as cards reviewed, mastery levels, and daily streaks.
- **Gamification**: Introduce badges, leaderboards, and challenges to keep users motivated.
- **Public Deck Sharing**: Allows users to share their decks with the community or download popular decks created by others.

## AI Assistant: The Future of Learning

We are actively working on integrating a **complete AI assistant system** into Leitlearn.com. This exciting feature will include:

- **AI-Generated Flashcards**: Automatically create personalized flashcards from user-uploaded text, documents, or questions.
- **Virtual AI Professor**: An interactive AI teacher that explains concepts, answers user queries, and provides tailored learning strategies.

This cutting-edge technology will make Leitlearn.com a one-stop solution for all your learning needs, blending the efficiency of automation with the personal touch of expert guidance.

## Challenges and Improvements

Relaunching Leitlearn.com presented its share of challenges, including:

- **Migrating from PHP to NextJS**: Adapting the old logic to a completely new framework while ensuring data consistency.
- **User Experience Design**: Crafting an interface that is both simple for beginners and powerful for advanced users.
- **Scalability**: Building an architecture capable of handling a growing user base and feature set.

With persistence and iterative improvements, we were able to overcome these hurdles, creating a platform that is fast, reliable, and enjoyable to use.

## Future Developments

The current version of Leitlearn.com is only the beginning. Here are some features planned for future updates:

- **Offline Mode**: Provides access to flashcards even without an internet connection, ensuring uninterrupted learning.
- **Mobile App**: Launch native iOS and Android applications for an even smoother experience.
- **Multilingual Support**: Expand accessibility with support for multiple languages.
