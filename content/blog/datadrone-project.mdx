In **September 2024**, I began my work-study program at MSH (Maison des Sciences de l'Homme) Lyon St-Etienne, where I had the opportunity to contribute to innovative projects in scientific research.

The **Datadrone** project emerged from a collaboration between the MSH of Clermont-Ferrand and Lyon St-Etienne to develop an innovative experimental platform for collecting and utilizing multi-sensor drone data.

## Project Overview

Datadrone was initiated within the framework of the INTELESPACE platform at MSH Clermont-Ferrand, which acquired a multi-sensor equipped drone (LiDAR, multispectral, and thermal) in 2017. This innovative platform offers researchers new possibilities for scientific image acquisition and analysis.

## Technical Contributions

As part of the platform's modernization efforts, I led several significant technical upgrades to ensure the system's longevity and performance:

### Framework Migration

One of the most crucial updates was the migration from **Symfony 4** to **Symfony 6.4**. This upgrade not only improved security and performance but also ensured the platform benefits from the latest PHP features and long-term support.

### Frontend Modernization

The frontend underwent a complete transformation:
- Replaced **Bootstrap** with **Tailwind CSS** for more flexible and maintainable styling
- Updated all JavaScript dependencies to their latest stable versions
- Implemented **TypeScript** for enhanced type safety and developer experience

These technical improvements have significantly enhanced the platform's maintainability, security, and overall user experience while ensuring its sustainability for future research projects.

## Ongoing Development

I am currently working on enhancing the drone data import management to streamline the process through the web interface. This improvement will make data processing more efficient and user-friendly, further advancing the platform's capabilities in supporting scientific research projects.
